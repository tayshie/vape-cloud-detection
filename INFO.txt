Vape Cloud Measurement App
---------------------------
A desktop application that uses the webcam feed to detect vape clouds in real-time,
highlight them with a bounding box, and measure the (relative) size of the detected cloud.
The GUI is developed using PyQt5, while OpenCV handles video capture and image processing.

Core functionalities include:
   - Webcam selection and live feed display.
   - Real-time vape cloud detection and measurement.
   - Adjustable detection sensitivity via a settings slider.
   - Data logging (optional â€“ if recording is enabled, measurements are saved for later export).
   - A modern, aesthetically pleasing dark-style GUI.
